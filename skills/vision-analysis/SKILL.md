  "analyze", "analyse", "describe", "explain", "understand", "look at", "review",
  "extract text", "OCR", "what is in", "what's in", "read this image", "see this image",
  "tell me about", "explain this", "interpret this", in connection with an image, screenshot,
  diagram, chart, mockup, wireframe, or photo.
  Also triggers for: clipboard screenshots (macOS pastes like clipboard-YYYY-MM-DD-*.png),
  UI mockup review, wireframe analysis, design critique, data extraction from charts,
  object detection, person/animal/activity identification.
  Triggers: any message with an image file extension (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, svg),
  or any clipboard reference (clipboard-*.png), or any request to
  analyze/describ/understand/review/extract text from an image, screenshot,

# Vision Analysis

Analyze images using the MiniMax `MiniMax_understand_image` MCP tool available in the MiniMax Token Plan.

## Prerequisites

- MiniMax Token Plan subscription with valid `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
- MiniMax MCP configured (`MiniMax_understand_image` tool available)

### If MCP tool is not configured

**Step 1:** The agent should fetch setup instructions from:
**https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/token-plan/mcp-guide**

**Step 2:** Detect the user's environment (OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) and output the exact commands needed. Common examples:

**OpenCode** — add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `package.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "MiniMax": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["uvx", "minimax-coding-plan-mcp", "-y"],
      "environment": {
        "MINIMAX_API_KEY": "YOUR_TOKEN_PLAN_KEY",
        "MINIMAX_API_HOST": "https://api.minimaxi.com"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code**:
```bash
claude mcp add -s user MiniMax --env MINIMAX_API_KEY=your-key --env MINIMAX_API_HOST=https://api.minimaxi.com -- uvx minimax-coding-plan-mcp -y
```

**Cursor** — add to MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MiniMax": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["minimax-coding-plan-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MINIMAX_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "MINIMAX_API_HOST": "https://api.minimaxi.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3:** After configuration, tell the user to restart their app and verify with `/mcp`.

**Important:** If the user does not have a MiniMax Token Plan subscription, inform them that the `understand_image` tool requires one — it cannot be used with free or other tier API keys.

## Analysis Modes

| Mode | When to use | Prompt strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `describe` | General image understanding | Ask for detailed description |
| `ocr` | Text extraction from screenshots, documents | Ask to extract all text verbatim |
| `ui-review` | UI mockups, wireframes, design files | Ask for design critique with suggestions |
| `chart-data` | Charts, graphs, data visualizations | Ask to extract data points and trends |
| `object-detect` | Identify objects, people, activities | Ask to list and locate all elements |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Auto-detect image

The skill triggers automatically when a message contains:
- An image file path or URL with extensions: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.svg`
- A clipboard reference (e.g., `clipboard-YYYY-MM-DD-*.png` from macOS screenshot paste)
- Any request to analyze an image from the clipboard

Extract the image path from the message. If the path starts with `clipboard-` or refers to a clipboard image, handle it specially (see Step 1b).

### Step 1b: Handle clipboard images

If the image path looks like a macOS clipboard screenshot paste (e.g., `clipboard-2026-04-04-150832-31CED8F8.png`) or the user says "this screenshot" or "clipboard image":

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 skills/vision-analysis/scripts/clipboard_image.py
# Saves clipboard image to /tmp/vision-clipboard-<timestamp>.png
# Output: /tmp/vision-clipboard-20260404_150832.png
```

**Important:** Always use `/usr/bin/python3` — do NOT use `python3` alone. The agent's PATH may not include python3, but `/usr/bin/python3` exists on macOS and most Linux systems. If `/usr/bin/python3` is not found, try `/usr/local/bin/python3`.

The agent should:
1. Call the clipboard script
2. Use the returned path with `MiniMax_understand_image`

**Platform requirements:**
- macOS: no extra tools needed (uses osascript)
- Linux: requires `xclip` or `wl-paste` installed
- Windows: requires PowerShell

If the clipboard script fails (exit code 1 = no image in clipboard, exit code 2 = platform unsupported), inform the user and ask them to save the screenshot to a file first.

### Step 2: Select analysis mode and call MCP tool

Use the `MiniMax_understand_image` tool with a mode-specific prompt:

**describe:**
```
Provide a detailed description of this image. Include: main subject, setting/background,
colors/style, any text visible, notable objects, and overall composition.
```

**ocr:**
```
Extract all text visible in this image verbatim. Preserve structure and formatting
(headers, lists, columns). If no text is found, say so.
```

**ui-review:**
```
You are a UI/UX design reviewer. Analyze this interface mockup or design. Provide:
(1) Strengths — what works well, (2) Issues — usability or design problems,
(3) Specific, actionable suggestions for improvement. Be constructive and detailed.
```

**chart-data:**
```
Extract all data from this chart or graph. List: chart title, axis labels, all
data points/series with values if readable, and a brief summary of the trend.
```

**object-detect:**
```
List all distinct objects, people, and activities you can identify. For each,
describe what it is and its approximate location in the image.
```

### Step 3: Present results

Return the analysis clearly. For `describe`, use readable prose. For `ocr`, preserve structure. For `ui-review`, use a structured critique format.

## Output Format Example

For describe mode:
```
## Image Description

[Detailed description of the image contents...]
```

For ocr mode:
```
## Extracted Text

[Preserved text structure from the image]
```

For ui-review mode:
```
## UI Design Review

### Strengths
- ...

### Issues
- ...

### Suggestions
- ...
```

## Notes

- Images up to 20MB supported (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Local file paths work if MiniMax MCP is configured with file access
- The `MiniMax_understand_image` tool is provided by the `minimax-coding-plan-mcp` package
- **Clipboard images**: For macOS clipboard pastes (e.g., `clipboard-2026-04-04-*.png`), use the clipboard helper script before calling the MCP tool. Linux requires `xclip` or `wl-paste`. Windows uses PowerShell.
